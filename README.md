# About

Dictionaries compiled by the Tibetan in Digital Communication project ([larkpie.net/tibetancorpus](http://larkpie.net/tibetancorpus/)).

> First, we make use of a processed and somewhat modified version of Nathan Hill's A Lexicon of Tibetan Verb Stems as Reported by the Grammatical Tradition. Using this lexicon, we have been able to pre-tag many verb stems and verbal nouns whose tags would otherwise not be known.

> In addition to the verb lexicon, we also generate mini-lexicons for each text or text collection that is being tagged. Finally, the complete lexicon comprises the main corpus together with the verb lexicon.

> All software written as part of this project will be released under an open source license. Our Tibetan pos tagging software, incorporating a word segmentation component, will be released on Tibetan NLP, a GitHub page collecting tools and resources related to natural language processing of Tibetan. The page also has contributions from the Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center and the Tibetan & Himalayan Library.
